This project is a user-friendly and colorful weather app built with React. It allows users to query current weather information for cities worldwide and display this information in side-by-side cards for up to three different cities, making it easy for users to keep track of the weather.

Features:

Search Bar: Users can retrieve weather information by typing city names into the search bar. The input field is automatically cleared after a search is performed.
City Cards: Upon search, the weather information for the selected cities is displayed in the form of cards on the screen. These cards include the city's name, country, temperature, and weather description. Additionally, icons representing the weather condition are displayed on the cards.
Limited City Queries: Users can view the weather for up to three cities simultaneously. If a fourth city is queried, the oldest queried city will be removed from the list.
City Removal: Each city card features an 'X' icon that allows users to remove the card from the list.
Error Messages: Users receive warnings when entering nonexistent or incorrect city names.
Responsive Design: The app has been designed to be compatible with different screen sizes and devices.
This weather app provides users with an easy way to check weather information for cities and offers a dynamic, user-friendly experience.
